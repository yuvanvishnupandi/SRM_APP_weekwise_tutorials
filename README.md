* String manipulation

### Week 2: Loops & Basic Data Structures
* Introduction to loops (`for`, `while`)
* Problem-solving with arrays
* Basic class and object interaction

### Week 3: Introduction to OOP
* Creating classes and objects (`Student`, `Employee`, `BankAccount`)
* Defining instance variables and methods
* Using constructors

### Week 4: Encapsulation & System Design
